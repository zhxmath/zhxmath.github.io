* <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HIMA">HIMA: An R package for high-dimensional mediation analysis.</a>  We develop a user-friendly R package  HIMA on high-dimensional mediation analysis with varying mediator and outcome specifications. Specifically, the HIMA package is comprehensive to deal with four kinds of high-dimensional mediation effects, including linear mediation model with continuous outcomes, logistic mediation model with binary outcomes, survival mediation model with censored data, and microbiome mediation model with compositional data.
