* <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HIMA">HIMA: An R package for high-dimensional mediation analysis.</a>  We develop a user-friendly R package  HIMA on high-dimensional mediation analysis with varying mediator and outcome specifications. The HIMA package is comprehensive to deal with four kinds of high-dimensional mediation effects, including linear mediation model with continuous outcomes, logistic mediation model with binary outcomes, survival mediation model with censored data, and microbiome mediation model with compositional data. 

* <a href="https://github.com/zhxmath/AdjMed">AdjMed: An R package for performing adjusted joint significance test and sobel-type confidence interval for mediation effect.</a>  The AdjMed has two R functions for performing adjusted mediation analysis, where AJS( ) is used to perform adjusted joint significance test for mediation effect, and ASobel( ) is used to perform adjusted sobel-type confidence interval for mediation effect.
