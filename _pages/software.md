* <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HIMA">HIMA: An R package for high-dimensional mediation analysis.</a>  We develop a user-friendly R package  HIMA on high-dimensional mediation analysis with varying mediator and outcome specifications. The HIMA package is comprehensive to deal with four kinds of high-dimensional mediation effects, including linear mediation model with continuous outcomes, logistic mediation model with binary outcomes, survival mediation model with censored data, and microbiome mediation model with compositional data. 

* <a href="https://github.com/zhxmath/AdapMed">AdapMed: An R package for performing adaptive joint significance test and sobel-type confidence interval for mediation effect.</a>  The AdapMed has two R functions for performing adaptive mediation analysis, where AJS is used to perform adaptive joint significance test for mediation effect, and ASobel is used to perform adaptive sobel-type confidence interval for mediation effect.
