I believe its important to provide software to easily implement methods that I have proposed in papers. Currently I have an R package on CRAN for penalized quantile regression and a shiny app for estimating conditional quantiles. I expect this list to grow and the software to be updated with additional features.

* <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HIMA">HIMA: An R package for high-dimensional mediation analysis.</a> High-dimensional mediation analysis plays an important role in many research  fields, yet it is very challenging to perform estimation and test for high-dimensional mediators. We develop a user-friendly R package  HIMA on high-dimensional mediation analysis with varying mediator and outcome specifications. Specifically, the HIMA package is comprehensive to deal with four kinds of high-dimensional mediation effects, including linear mediation model with continuous outcomes, logistic mediation model with binary outcomes, survival mediation model with censored data, and microbiome mediation model with compositional data.
